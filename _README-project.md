Purpose
-------
The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point
for hosted web applications. The focus is on rapid development
of complex project involving hundreds of pages and rapid changing
requirements that often require significant changes to exising
design.

This is primarily intended as a way to share a repository
of interconnected tools and frameworks that have been developed
by various developers. Licensing these generic tools as open
source makes it easier to bootstrap some of our new commercial
projects as well as allowing us to reuse these tools on personal
projects.
