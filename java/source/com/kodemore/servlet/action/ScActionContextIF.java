     * handling any specific errors that it can reasonably know about.
     * For example, suppose the action is validating and updating the

     * check the email, and if empty, display a custom error message
     * where appropriate.  This case should generally NOT throw an
     * application exception out of the handler.
     *

     * for local action handlers to manage politely, without an explosion
     * of error handling code for cases that are very rare.  Therefore
     * it is considered acceptable for virtually any part of the application
     * (or framework) to throw an Application Exception.  Doing so should
     * abort the current operation, rollback any database transaction, and
     * politely display the error to the user.
