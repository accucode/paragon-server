        Indicates whether shipments on this account will be automatically billed to the customer by the carrier.\n This is independent from the customer.  For example, this could be set to true, even if this account is not associated with a specific customer.  Also, this could be set to false even if this account is associated with a single specific customer.<br>

        This indicates who the carrier should bill, and is used when configuring the third party carrier.\n Sender: Bill to the sender, that is, ourselves.  This is the normal option for non-customer specific accounts.\n Receiving: Bill the party receiving the shipment.  This options is almost never used.  It introduces a number of potential issues, and may imply C.O.D. terms and the potential that the shipment will be refused at the receiving end.\n ThirdParty: This is the option we typically use when configuring accounts that are associated with a customer.  Some additional set up and verification is generally required to coordinate permission with the customer and the carrier.  But once set up, this allows us to ship directly against the customer's account.<br>
