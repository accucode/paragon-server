        The unique key. In practice, this is often the (simple) name of the java class that is being run.  The names generally do not matter, as long as they are consistent across all JVMs.<br>

        The unique id of a particular JVM.  This is typically generated as a random UID within the JVM rather than trying to rely on an externally generated value.  It is understood that restarting a JVM will likely change the ownerUid even if it is the only JVM on that machine.<br>
