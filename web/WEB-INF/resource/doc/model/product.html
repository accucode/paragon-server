            <i>Help</i><br>
        In many cases, a customer-specific discount is applied to the list price in order to determine the actual sell price of the item for a particular order. However, in some cases the item is NOT subject to discounts.\n For example, we may define an product called \"$50 Delayed Install Discount\" with a price -100.00.  This product provide a convenient way to give customers a standard discount for delayed installations.  But we would NOT want to apply the customer's discount rate to the list price defined for this item.<br>

If a product is some type of package that includes multiple items, then it must be set to taxable if even a single sub-component is taxable.\n Additional rules related to sales tax are checked for each order.  If a particular order is flagged as tax exempt, then we will not apply sales tax even if the items are taxable.<br>
