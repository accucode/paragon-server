    A depot generally represents a facility where
    work is processed for a particular project.  Usually, a depot is configured
    to correspond to a single building or street address.  However, in some cases
    it may be useful to define multiple depots within a single physical building,
    or to group multiple physical buildings together as a single depot.  Each
    worker is assigned to a single depot.  Additionally, product inventory (quantity
    on hand) is tracked by depot.  Note: multiple project may define the same depot,
    such as "Denver," but each depot is specific to its project and each depot
    maintains a separate inventory, even if multiple projects contain a depot with
    the same name.
